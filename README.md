## Description
Gear Store is an application designed to facilitate the lending and borrowing of sports equipment. Users can browse through available gear and make bookings, and this gives admin users a very adequate borrowing history so gear can't go missing!

Clicking on one of these categories reveals details of the category, and allows users to peruse these available items.
